# Add visualization to a panel

For each panel, you must select a visualization to display the results of your query.

Before you begin, familiarize yourself with Grafana [panels]({{< relref "../panels/_index.md" >}}) and [dashboards]({{< relref "../dashboards/_index.md" >}}). See also, [Visualization-suggestions]({{< relref "./_index.md##visualization-suggestion" >}}) in Grafana.

To add visualization to a panel:

1. Create a new panel or update an existing panel following instructions in [Add a panel]({{< relref "../panels/working-with-panels/add-panel.md" >}}).
1. Click on the Visualization list at the top of the right pane and select a visualization. By default, the Time series visualization is selected.
