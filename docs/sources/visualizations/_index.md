# About Grafana visualizations

Visualizations allow you to quickly gather insights from metrics, logs or tracing data displayed in Grafana dashboards and panels and help make better business decisions by identifying areas for improvement.

## Visualization suggestions

Grafana offers a variety of visualizations. If you are unsure which visualization to select for your panel, we can provide visualization suggestions based on your panel query. Once you select a visualization, Grafana shows a preview of the data with that visualization applied. For more information, see the [add a panel]({{< relref "../panels/working-with-panels/add-panel.md" >}}) documentation.

This section has the following topics:

- [Visualization reference]({{< relref "./viz-reference.md" >}}) - Lists the types of visualizations in Grafana and provides guidance on which one to use.
- [Visualization examples]({{< relref "./viz-examples.md" >}}) - Visualization examples to give you an idea on how best to display your data.
