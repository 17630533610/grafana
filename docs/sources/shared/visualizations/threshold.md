### Thresholds

The Thresholds section shows the number of configured thresholds for the panel. For example, if there are two thresholds, you will see the number 2 next to  the **Thresholds** section heading. For more information on thresholds, see [About thresholds]({{< relref "../panels/specify-thresholds/about-thresholds.md" >}}).

Click **Thresholds** to expand the section to view details. Thresholds can be:
- **Absolute-** (Default) Based on a number. For example, 80 on a scale of 1 to 150.
- **Percentage-** Relative to minimum or maximum number. For example, 80%.

The default "Base" threshold is always green and cannot be deleted. To delete another threshold, click the trash can icon next to the threshold. 

To add a new threshold, click **Add threshold** and follow the instructions in [Add a threshold]({{< relref "../panels/specify-thresholds/add-a-threshold.md" >}}).
